# WooCommerce -> Shopify migration

This is a dodgy attempt at migrating products from a WooCommerce product dump to a shopify store.

I do not know how to use python. So there's that. Half of it was written by ChatGPT.

It works if you only have standard products (I think)

If you have variants it breaks. My test store does not have any other product types, so I have no idea about them.

If you use it and it breaks your store thats on you.


## Setup the secrets

Copy keys.py.bak to keys.py
Stick in the secrets and stuff.


## Contribute

If you come across this and want to contribute, I'm all for it.

If you have complaints about bugs of lack of features. I may look into it, but probably not.

## Final note

This was done for my own edification to see if I could.
