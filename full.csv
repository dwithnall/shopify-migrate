42813,simple,5-037,,Large Letterman Triptych Wall Art,1,0,visible,"""The typical Letterman painting is not a painting at all. Most of them were manufactured (using a silkscreen-like process) in the Far East (China or perhaps the Philipines) during the 1970s and sold at JC Penney stores in the U.S.
\n
\n<b>Letterman</b> oil ""<b>paintings""</b> are a collection of works created to look like original oil <b>paintings</b>. Although there is no single <b>Letterman artist</b>, the <b>paintings</b> themselves are collectible by fans for their place in mid-century Americana.
\n

Just as relevant and striking as the day it was designed, this vintage piece would take pride of place in any home today.

\n
\nThe Togo collection was originally designed in 1973 by Michel Ducaroy, a French designer who was born into a family of furniture makers and designers. He trained at the Ecole Nationale des Beaux Arts in Lyon [and in the family business] before branching out on his own as an independent furniture designer in 1952. He met Jean Roset in 1954 and rapidly became one of Ligne Roset’s most integral designers; pushing the company’s technological boundaries in design. In 1973, Ducaroy designed what he would be remembered for - the now iconic TOGO.

He studied at the National School of Architecture in Rio de Janeiro. After graduating in 1952, Rodrigues began to focus more on furniture design, and, in partnership with Italian designers the Hauner brothers, opened Moveis Artesanal Paranaense, the first modern art and furniture store in Curitiba. In 1955, he founded Oca, an Ipanema-based brand focused on the development of modern Brazilian furniture. He remained with the company until 1968. Between 1963 and 1968, Rodrigues also worked at Meia-Pataca, a design firm that specialized in series production and affordable furniture.
\n
\nRecognized internationally as one of Brazil’s most influential modern designers, Rodrigues has since focused on creating furniture lines for international industrial production, hotels, offices, and residences, including a variety of work for pre-fab homes. Several of his designs have graced the interiors of Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer’s Brasilia buildings. Perhaps Rodrigues' most famous project, however, is the Mole armchair (1957), which won first prize at the 1961 International Furniture Competition in Italy and attracted international recognition. Produced by ISA in Italy, the chair was sold internationally under the name Sheriff.

Jorge Zalszupin, who arrived from Poland in 1949, created consistently sleek and elegant chairs, tables and case pieces using the South American country’s vibrantly grained tropical hardwoods. While Zalszupin cannot be said to have had a signature style, his furniture designs all share a characteristic simplicity and purity of line and form.

\n“The piece of furniture is not just the shape, not just the material which is made but also something inside it. It's the piece's spirit. It's the Brazilian spirit. It's the Brazilian furniture” Sergio Rodrigues (September 22, 1927 – September 1, 2014) was a Brazilian architect and designer. Along with Joaquim Tenreiro and José Zanine Caldas, Rodrigues was the pioneer to transform the Brazilian design in industrial design and make it known worldwide. He began his work in the field of architecture in the project of the civic center along with architects David Azambuja, Flávio Régis do Nascimento e Olavo redig de Campos.
\n
\nHe had the peak of his career in the 50s and 60s. Working with furniture design in the modernism era, bringing the Brazilian identity to his projects, both in the design and traditional materials – leather, wood and rattan – exalting the Brazilian and native culture.

\n
\nBorn in 1913 in Vienna, Austria, Martin Eisler received his architecture degree in 1936. However, as in the life of so many Brazilian designers, it was the looming thundercloud of the second world war that made him move just after his studies were finished. First to Czechoslovakia (where his parents lived) and later, in 1938, to Argentina. Here Eisler began to exercise his profession as an architect and interior designer and opened up his interior design firm, later named Interieur Forma. In the early 1950s he decided to move to Brazil.

\nBorn in Brescia in 1927, Carlo Hauner studied technical drawing and drawing at the Brera Academy in Milan, Italy. In 1948, he successfully participated in the Venice Biennale after which he moved to Brazil, where he dedicated himself to the design of textile, ceramics, furniture and architecture. In only a very short time he founded a furniture production company and purchased a factory from Lino Ba Bardi and her husband Pietro Bardi, renaming it Móveis Artesanal.
\n
\nIn 1953 Hauner met Martin Eisler, who was looking for help to produce furniture for the home of his brother-in-law, Ernesto Wolf. Eisler reached out to Hauner and the rest is history. The two men connected and with Wolf’s financial backing, they opened Galeria Artesanal (a store to their company Móveis Artesenal) on a busy street in São Paulo. Being highly ambitious and with an eye on the international market as well as the upcoming office market, Móvies Artesanal later changed into Forma. Together with Oca, Forma became one of the biggest names in Brazilian furniture production. Even managing to attract an exclusive licence to sell Knoll furniture bringing big names in international design such as Mies Van Der Rohe, Charles Eames and Harry Bertoia to the Brazilian furniture market.
\n
\nHauner and Eisler’s designs are characterized by the use of Brazilian woods, thin tubular frames and range from furniture, to ceramics and textiles. Some of their most famous designs are the concha / haia chair (in English often referred to as ‘shell’ chair) and the ‘Costela’ lounge chair. In 1958 Hauner, supposedly on instigation of his Italian wife, decided to return to Italy to open Forma di Brescia, which catered to e.g., the embassy of Brazil in Rome and Vatican City. Eventually Hauner sold his part of the company, leaving Eisler solely at the helm, to focus himself on painting and the making of wine on Salina, a little isle just above Sicily. After a full life the artist, designer and serial entrepreneur died in 1997.

However, as in the life of so many Brazilian designers, it was the looming thundercloud of the second world war that made him move just after his studies were finished. First to Czechoslovakia (where his parents lived) and later, in 1938, to Argentina. Here Eisler began to exercise his profession as an architect and interior designer and opened up his interior design firm, later named Interieur Forma. In the early 1950s he decided to move to Brazil.

\n“The piece of furniture is not just the shape, not just the material which is made but also something inside it. It's the piece's spirit. It's the Brazilian spirit. It's the Brazilian furniture” Sergio Rodrigues (September 22, 1927 – September 1, 2014) was a Brazilian architect and designer. Along with Joaquim Tenreiro and José Zanine Caldas, Rodrigues was the pioneer to transform the Brazilian design in industrial design and make it known worldwide. He began his work in the field of architecture in the project of the civic center along with architects David Azambuja, Flávio Régis do Nascimento e Olavo redig de Campos.
\n
\nHe had the peak of his career in the 50s and 60s. Working with furniture design in the modernism era, bringing the Brazilian identity to his projects, both in the design and traditional materials – leather, wood and rattan – exalting the Brazilian and native culture.

\n
\nArtist, graphic decorator and architect, John Graz arrived in Brazil in 1920 from Geneva, Switzerland where he studied Fine Arts. Graz, who was a great draftsman, worked primarily in interior architecture creating furniture and sculptures.
\n
\nHe designed all the accessories for his projects - the concept underlying his work was a synthesis of arts, including painting, which he applied whether decorating the interiors of high class residences or designing lamps or jewels or sculptural pieces.
\n
\nHis furniture design was stylistically close to rationalism and to the Scandinavian Design school. He left many beautiful drawings of furniture, sculpture and accessories.

\n
\nThe Togo collection was originally designed in 1973 by Michel Ducaroy, a French designer who was born into a family of furniture makers and designers. He trained at the Ecole Nationale des Beaux Arts in Lyon [and in the family business] before branching out on his own as an independent furniture designer in 1952. He met Jean Roset in 1954 and rapidly became one of Ligne Roset’s most integral designers; pushing the company’s technological boundaries in design. In 1973, Ducaroy designed what he would be remembered for - the now iconic TOGO.

49584,simple,,,Letterman Wall Art - Abstract Landscape with Forest (Browns/Cream),1,0,visible,"“The typical Letterman painting is not a painting at all. Most of them were manufactured (using a silkscreen-like process) in the Far East (China or perhaps the Philipines) during the 1970s and sold at JC Penney stores in the U.S.
\nLetterman oil “paintings” are a collection of works created to look like original oil paintings. Although there is no single Letterman artist, the paintings themselves are collectible by fans for their place in mid-century Americana.
\nThe original artist was typically a “company man” or woman and therefore not acknowledged. They were contract or salary employees whose work-product became property of the company they worked for. Their work was copied much like a computer graphics image is used (copied) to create T-shirts using multi-colored passes and a silk-screen pattern.

\n
\nSergio Rodrigues is credited as the father of modern design in Brazil for having introduced a uniquely Brazilian formal vocabulary with the Mole Armchair, so named for its relaxed, comfortable, soft appearance, summarized by the word ""mole"" in Portuguese.

\n
\nBorn in 1913 in Vienna, Austria, Martin Eisler received his architecture degree in 1936. However, as in the life of so many Brazilian designers, it was the looming thundercloud of the second world war that made him move just after his studies were finished. First to Czechoslovakia (where his parents lived) and later, in 1938, to Argentina. Here Eisler began to exercise his profession as an architect and interior designer and opened up his interior design firm, later named Interieur Forma. In the early 1950s he decided to move to Brazil.
\n
\nBorn in Brescia in 1927, Carlo Hauner studied technical drawing and drawing at the Brera Academy in Milan, Italy. In 1948, he successfully participated in the Venice Biennale after which he moved to Brazil, where he dedicated himself to the design of textile, ceramics, furniture and architecture. In only a very short time he founded a furniture production company and purchased a factory from Lino Ba Bardi and her husband Pietro Bardi, renaming it Móveis Artesanal.
\n
\nIn 1953 Hauner met Martin Eisler, who was looking for help to produce furniture for the home of his brother-in-law, Ernesto Wolf. Eisler reached out to Hauner and the rest is history. The two men connected and with Wolf’s financial backing, they opened Galeria Artesanal (a store to their company Móveis Artesenal) on a busy street in São Paulo. Being highly ambitious and with an eye on the international market as well as the upcoming office market, Móvies Artesanal later changed into Forma. Together with Oca, Forma became one of the biggest names in Brazilian furniture production. Even managing to attract an exclusive licence to sell Knoll furniture bringing big names in international design such as Mies Van Der Rohe, Charles Eames and Harry Bertoia to the Brazilian furniture market.
\n
\nHauner and Eisler’s designs are characterized by the use of Brazilian woods, thin tubular frames and range from furniture, to ceramics and textiles. Some of their most famous designs are the concha / haia chair (in English often referred to as ‘shell’ chair) and the ‘Costella’ lounge chair. In 1958 Hauner, supposedly on instigation of his Italian wife, decided to return to Italy to open Forma di Brescia, which catered to e.g., the embassy of Brazil in Rome and Vatican City. Eventually Hauner sold his part of the company, leaving Eisler solely at the helm, to focus himself on painting and the making of wine on Salina, a little isle just above Sicily. After a full life the artist, designer and serial entrepreneur died in 1997.",,,,taxable,,1,1,1,0,0,,,,,0,,,12800,"Chairs, Consignment, Eternity Design Collection, Growing Home with Jamie Durie, Chairs > Lounge chairs, Designers > Martin Eisler and Carlo Hauner, Chairs > Occasional Chairs",,,"https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Photo-10-11-2023-12-39-40-pm.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Photo-10-11-2023-12-40-18-pm.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Photo-10-11-2023-12-40-37-pm.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Photo-10-11-2023-12-40-44-pm.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Photo-10-11-2023-12-41-07-pm.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Photo-10-11-2023-12-39-11-pm.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Photo-10-11-2023-12-39-47-pm.jpg",,,,,,,,,0,,Designer,Martin Eisler and Carlo Hauner,1,1,default,2.43935E+16,yes,yes,,product,,210,Country,Brazil,1,1,Year,1960's,1,1,Materials,"iron frame, wool upholstery",1,1,,,,,,,,,,[],"[""""]",555,19/03/2024,28/04/2024,2.43935E+16,no,0,1,1730600761,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He started the business to create jobs for his two sons who were both hearing impaired. Both his sons were very apt in using their hands so weaving was suitable. Yuzuru Yamakawa who was fortunate not to have the handicap as his brothers was asked to join the company to help the family in managing the business. He studied at design school at night while working in the business during the day. His efforts and talent made Yamakawa Rattan grow to become one of the most renowned company in Japan specialized in creating high quality design oriented rattan furniture.

He trained at the Ecole Nationale des Beaux Arts in Lyon [and in the family business] before branching out on his own as an independent furniture designer in 1952. He met Jean Roset in 1954 and rapidly became one of Ligne Roset’s most integral designers; pushing the company’s technological boundaries in design. In 1973, Ducaroy designed what he would be remembered for - the now iconic TOGO.

Eternity Design Collections,1,0,visible,"Michel Arnoult was a French-born designer who later became an adoptive Brazilian, and he is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of the Ready-To-Assemble furniture (RTA) and flat-packaging. In the early 1950s, he arrived in Brazil and quickly made friends with some of the leading figures in modern architecture, such as Oscar Niemeyer and Cândido Portinari. At the time, there was a shortage of furniture suitable for the smaller spaces in social housing, which prompted Michel Arnoult to design simple but functional RTA furniture with his company Mobilia Contemporanea
\n
\nHis innovative and daring approach at the time proved incredibly successful, earning him several prestigious awards, including the Roberto Simonsen Prize for industrial design in 1964, and the Museo da Casa Brasileira Prize in 2003.

42517,simple,3-490,,Set of 3 Eames DAG Shell Chairs with small Fibreglass Table,1,0,visible,"The original first generation of the Eames dining chairs were released in 1950 and were known as the <strong>Eames DAX Chair -</strong>Dining (D) Arm Chair (A) on X Base (X). ""The <strong>DAG</strong> was added to the series in 1954 and was exact to the DAX only with longer rear legs to ‘guard’ the shell against wall impact and thus the Dining (D) Height, Arm (A) Chair on Guard (G) base was born. It is also worth noting that Herman Miller replaced the X base in 1954 with what was later to be termed the ‘H’ base, which was more versatile and aesthetically more appealing and thinner. The later DAG therefore only appeared in the H base but the abbreviated name for the chairs was kept the same to avoid confusions.""

\nAbout the maker: Eddie Kappell started his business with his brother in 1983, making bespoke pieces for private clients &amp; architects. They were the  1st business to recycle Australian hardwoods using large section timbers from wool stores and old buildings that were being demolished, revitalising the timber into products such as wide board flooring and furniture. Not being trained in conventional joinery techniques, they developed their own. Along the way, they were asked to quote on a number of jobs that led them to do all the timberwork at Longrain Restaurant in Surry Hills in 1999, some of the detail joinery at the Aria Restaurant opposite the Opera House in 2000, as well as other well known restaurants around town. With gained knowledge and experience from these jobs, they designed their own range of furniture of which these stools are a prime example.

Twin brothers and architects Ib and Jørgen Rasmussen designed it as a company chair for KEVI A/S in 1958. More than 2.5 million chairs have been produced since that time as it meets the demands of busy work environments and the need for ergonomic design.\n\nThe Rasmussen brothers designed the chair with the concept that everything be visible and nothing be superfluous. The result? A chair with clean and light design, aesthetic appeal, and easy functionality.\n\nIn 1965 Jørgen invented the ?twin-wheel castor? that meant the chair could move even more easily and freely. Many believe that there is still no better wheel for chairs and it has since been used by Bang &amp; Olufsen, Philips, IKEA, and many more product manufacturers.

It has four lower drawers, a fall front lid that opens to a large work space, and small drawers, shelves, and vertical dividers above. While compact and designed for functionality, it is also eye-catching with clean lines, Mogensen?s signature handles, and the warm golden grain of teak.\n\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, Søborg Møbler worked with Danish furniture designers to experiment with, manufacture, and display furniture. Mogensen, being one of those designers, applied an almost scientific analysis of functionality to his work. He never bowed to the whims of fashion or expensive materials, and instead used strong and simple lines and subtly updated and reinvented traditional forms.\n\nHis bureau is both elegant and practical and serves as an ideal solution for a range of living spaces.

Each had curvaceous forms, slender legs, and plush velvety texture.\n\nThe Sir and Lady are, of course, the famous chairs that have been signature Artflex pieces for more than sixty years. In 1948 Artflex commissioned Zanuso to design its first furniture models using new foam-rubber upholstery. Zanuso praised the material as it enabled designers to revolutionise the system of upholstery and structural manufacturing, and to create visually exciting and inventive contours.\n\nZanuso designed the Sir Chair in 1949 and the Lady Chair in 1951 and each consisted of a series of elements that were individually upholstered and then assembled together.

Made of one continuous piece of plywood (originally sans upholstery) the chair ergonomically supported the natural curves of the body; and its natural wood and curving back added organic form and warmth to the striking glass and concrete modern buildings.\n\nJacobsen intended the elegant and sophisticated high-back chairs for the professors of St. Catherine?s College as the elongated back served as a symbol of prestige. The swivelling base facilitated conversation and interaction while the high-back allowed for privacy.\n\nFollowing the success of the chairs, Fritz Hansen launched the Oxford series in 1965 adding upholstery and padding to the chair.",,,,taxable,,0,0,,0,0,,,,,0,,,0,Other,,,"https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Arne-Jacobsen-Oxford-high-backed-chair.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Arne-Jacobsen-Oxford-high-backed-chair-1.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Arne-Jacobsen-Oxford-high-backed-chair-2.jpg",,,,,,,,,934,,OldID,2654,0,0,default,,,,,,,,Old ID,2654,0,0,Materials,"Leather, Metal",1,1,Designer,Arne Jacobsen,1,1,Producer,Fritz Hansen,1,1,Producer,Fritz Hansen,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Country,Denmark,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,Year,Designed in 1963,1,0,Materials,"Leather, Metal",1,0,Price,SOLD,0,0,,,,,,,,

It has leather seats, a chrome frame and slim chrome legs. While it is well proportioned with a light appearance, there is more going on in the construction and design of this sofa than meets the eye.\n\nThe story goes that George and his wife Jacqueline were taking a drive through the French countryside in a Citroen 2CV Nelson.

24377,simple,Import_1859,,Hans Wegner CH33 dining chair,1,0,visible,"Model CH33. An original CH33 dining chair is a very rare item to find. Wegner designed the chair in 1957, using a solid wood frame and veneer seat and back, for production by Carl Hansen &amp; Son. Carl Hansen produced it for only ten years ? not reintroducing it again until 2012 to mark the one-hundredth anniversary of Wegner?s birth.

Designed and manufactured circa 1935 it has a subtly curved high-back, arms that culminate in fist-like forms, and elegant legs that appear to sit lightly on the floor.\n\nWorking in the 1930s and 1940s Henningsen preceded the mid-century Danish designers and his work consequently bears more traditional lines and forms than the clean simplicity of Danish modern. Henningsen took on the task of both designing and producing and made every piece by hand often using exotic woods such as rosewood and mahogany in combination with warm leather upholstery.\n\nHenningsen took a traditional approach to style and comfort and believed furniture should have curving forms for a homely look. He drew on a consistent design vocabulary that has made his work instantly recognisable: softly curved backs, arms, and wings that are both modern and traditional. These elements are visible in the high-back armchair at Vampt Vintage.",,,,taxable,,0,0,,0,0,,,,,0,,,0,Other,,,"https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Frits-Henningsen-leather-armchair.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Frits-Henningsen-leather-armchair-1.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Frits-Henningsen-leather-armchair-2.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Frits-Henningsen-leather-armchair-3.jpg",,,,,,,,,1122,,OldID,1608,0,0,default,,,,,,,,Old ID,1608,0,0,Materials,"Leather, Mahogany",1,1,Designer,Frits Henningsen,1,1,Producer,Frits Henningsen,1,1,Country,Denmark,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Year,1930-1939,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,Materials,"Leather, Mahogany",1,0,Code,L662,0,0,Price,SOLD,0,0,,,,,,,,

\n
\n&nbsp;
\n
\nThe Expo Mark II sound chair is an enduring legacy of Australia’s contribution to the 1967 world exhibition in Montreal, Canada.
\n
\nThe Australian pavilion at Expo 67 included 240 sound chairs from Melbourne-based contemporary furniture designers Grant and Mary Featherston.
\n
\nThe chairs were commissioned by Robin Boyd, who designed the Australian pavilion’s interior and displays at Expo 67. Boyd commissioned the Featherstons to develop a ‘talking chair’ to deliver information about Australia to visitors in seated comfort.
\n
\nThe Mark II sound chair acquired by the National Museum in 2007 was produced between 1967 and 1970. It was adapted for the domestic market from the original Expo chair design by Aristoc Industries.
\n
\nThe sound chair was made by moulding the shell in expanded rigid polystyrene, which was then upholstered in polyurethane foam and wool. The headrest, back and base were constructed in one continuous circular form, with a winged back. A circular seat of polyurethane was set into the base of the frame and two speakers were fitted to the internal shell in the head bolster.",,,,taxable,,1,1,,0,0,,,,,0,,,22000,"Chairs, Designers, Designers > Grant Featherston, Chairs > Lounge chairs, Chairs > Occasional Chairs",,,"https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Photo-1-6-2024-10-27-17 AM.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Photo-1-6-2024-10-26-02 AM.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Photo-1-6-2024-10-27-10 AM.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Photo-1-6-2024-10-26-38 AM.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Photo-1-6-2024-10-28-12 AM.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Photo-1-6-2024-10-29-19 AM.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Photo-1-6-2024-10-29-38 AM.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Photo-1-6-2024-10-29-51 AM.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Photo-1-6-2024-10-29-13 AM.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Photo-1-6-2024-10-28-49 AM.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Photo-1-6-2024-10-28-36 AM.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Photo-1-6-2024-10-28-01 AM.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Photo-1-6-2024-10-26-59 AM.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Photo-1-6-2024-10-26-24 AM.jpg, https://vamptvintagedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Photo-1-6-2024-10-25-54 AM.jpg",,,,,,,,,1173,,Designer,Grant Featherston,1,1,default,,,no,,,,,Producer,Aristoc,1,1,Country,Australia,1,1,Year,1967-70,1,1,,,,,,,,,,[],"[""""]",554,1/06/2024,1/07/2024,,,1,1,1734134126,,,,22/05/2020,,,,,Pair available by Grant Featherston for Aristoc.
